pg_auto_failover is an extension and service for PostgreSQL that
monitors and manages automated failover for a Postgres cluster. It
is optimized for simplicity and correctness and supports Postgres
10 and newer.

We set up one PostgreSQL server as a monitor node as well as a
primary and secondary node for storing data. The monitor node tracks
the health of the data nodes and implements a failover state machine.
On the PostgreSQL nodes, the pg_autoctl program runs alongside
PostgreSQL and runs the necessary commands to configure synchronous
streaming replication.
