pcc-libs contains helper functions for some internal stuff in pcc,
like floating point, long long, complex etc...

Going back a bunch of years in history pcc-libs were not needed for
the BSD targets; most of the support functions were provided by
libc.  All other targets needed pcc-libs though.  Due to this
pcc-libs has been handled as a separate packet and maintained as
such.
